Hi, my name Christopher Hall and I interviewed for a Cloud Support Engineer position at CoreWeave!  I was successful in this process and started the role on 22nd July 2024!


During this exercise, I got the opportunity to learn more about:

- CoreWeave
- Kubernetes

I also decided that simply creating a document in Google Docs would have not been very exciting so I took it upon myself to go a bit further with the documentation and pretend I was writing for the CoreWeave blog/docs site.

I settled on writing markdown and deploying the markdown using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

This has allowed me to showcase my documentation site by uploading it to Github at: [coreweave](https://github.com/gitorion/coreweave) and doing a little bit of Github Pages gitops.

It was a great experience and I highly recommend CoreWeave and it's interview process to anyone looking to land a cool new position! ðŸ‘‹
